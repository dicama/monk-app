# MONK

## Getting Started
### Requirements

- Clone the repository with the 'git clone' command

```git
git clone git@github.com:dicama/monk.git
```
or download the zip-file.

- IDEs: Download either Android Studio/IntelliJ Idea or Visual Studio Code, with the respective [Flutter editor plugins](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor). For more information about the installation procedure of Flutter, we refer to the Single Source of Truth by checking the [official install guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) as well as the [official documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs).

- Install all dependencies from pubspec.yaml by running `flutter packages get` from the project root (see [using packages documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages#adding-a-package-dependency-to-an-app)). Pubspec.yaml thereby manages all assets and dependencies for
MONK. 

#### Run

CLI Debug: `flutter run monk lib/main.dart`

#### Build:

flutter build apk --split-per-abi --no-tree-shake-icons
